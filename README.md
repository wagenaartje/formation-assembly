- prove why relative distances are not enough
- use neural networks figures from croon paper, very clena!

BACKUP assignment:
- train using this simple algorithm
- then, evolve further.

First thing, we can backpropagate a network on manual control,
and then we can see if it evaluates correctly! If there is a
discrepancy... we can evolve afterwards. If not, super
tough problem.

--> extrapolate to larger groups!!!
