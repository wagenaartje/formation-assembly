First thing, we can backpropagate a network on manual control,
and then we can see if it evaluates correctly! If there is a
discrepancy... we can evolve afterwards. If not, super
tough problem.

--> extrapolate to larger groups!!!
--> make relative to group velocity
--> once working, use CMA-ES instead (or a variant, like Vlad supposes)

# Report tips
- Use neural networks visualization like in Croon's paper
- Mention number of parameters, number of dimensions, ranges etc.
- Compare to simple algorithm. Both average distance at end, plus time to certain radius!
